# Extra long factorials

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/extra-long-factorials/problem

Factorials n > 20 of can't be stored even in a 64 bit
long long variable. Big integers must be used for such calculations. Languages like Java, Python, Ruby etc. can handle big integers, but we need to write additional code in C/C++ to handle huge values.
We recommend solving this challenge using BigIntegers.
